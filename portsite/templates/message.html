				&emsp;&emsp;I am seriously so glad you were honest with me. I think that your honesty and sweetness were what I appreciated most about you. When we were dating and when I had realized I started falling out of love because of our problems I was very sad, but something else deep inside me always pushed me forward with hope. I had imagined visions in the future of you in love with someone who is not me, someone who can give you the love and memories you deserve. Someone who you will connect with deeply and feel truly in love.
			</p>
			<p>
				&emsp;&emsp;In life, love is full of failures and complicated situations that often end badly. But I am glad that this one ended well. While I know I won’t be mentally ready for a new relationship for a long time, I am so glad I feel that I can finally move on. Thank you for telling me about your new sweetheart, I know it must of been hard for you to reveal that to me. But I am seriously so glad you did, because I am so glad to know reality and to finally move on.

				&emsp;&emsp;I am so glad to hear about your job, I am so glad that you got it and finally have a great community experience in America. You deserved this life. You deserve the best from life and I am so proud of you for always working your hardest. I am in tears because how proud I am of you, and your parents are so proud too. I wish the best of health to your family. I hope you can see them soon and finally reconnect with your old friends too, you really deserve it.

				&emsp;&emsp;Honestly, in my head I hoped to ask you out one last time before you left for Hong Kong, just as a final goodbye. But it’s no longer possible, and I think that’s for the best. These past 4 years I was the most stressed  I had ever been in my life and I was addicted to escaping it. You really helped me survive my hardest hours and I will always appreciate you for helping me survive. I am not the perfect guy, just a human born randomly in this world, still trying to discover and understand myself. But one thing I always knew was that you were going to work your hardest and will have a bright future.

				&emsp;&emsp;I am going to make sure to pay back the remaining money I owe you soon. It’s a little rough right now because I have $40,000 to start paying soon, but I’ve always repaid my debts. I think I will always be curious about how your life is going, honestly I still care about you a lot. I feel that the car accident that you were in really opened something deep inside me that I had never felt so hard before in my life and I still think of it randomly sometimes. Life is so random and crazy and I am just so glad you are okay and alive. It made me realize how fragile life is. I was thinking about how much I cared about you and how much you cared for me, and how you wanted to make sure to be there for me on my graduation day, you cared about me more than my father ever did, enough to speed through a yellow light to make sure you’re there for me on my most important day. I really appreciate you more than I could ever put into words, you showed me the beautiful side of humanity, far outside the possibilities of my broken family.

					&emsp;&emsp;I am sorry for saying so much, I just could never live without having you know how I feel. I am so glad to see you starting the rest of your life in the best way. I am going to start working soon with my new client and I am excited to start my career. But look at you, you have already started, I am so proud. I am working to stay sober for this whole month and to make the best out of my life with a clear mind. I’m doing my best to have good mental health and I feel that I’m finally starting my new life. I would be lying if I said I don’t miss you. But I am so glad to finally feel that I can move on. I’ve always been such an emotional boy and I guess that’s why I always escaped it with weed. I think in my life you are the person who has understood me the most. But life has only just begun and the future is limitless.

				<p>
					&emsp;&emsp;I am happy to say I will forever be your ally, a connection you can always reach, a person you can always trust with any problem you may have. I feel that because of you I had the chance to experience a completely different part of life, humanity and love from across the world. I feel that through you I have become more connected with humanity itself. To bring a girl into our home, someone who looked different from us, who lived from language and culture so different from ours, I felt that I had finally accomplished connecting my family to the rest of the world, helping understand a land so far away that we had never seen, helping break racial walls, and finally helping connect humanity and my family together.
			</p>
				<p>
					&emsp;&emsp;I regret nothing about the past because it had led to this exact moment. And tonight I can rest easy knowing that you are becoming the best version of yourself. All the pain from the past was temporary, and your hard work and survival has brought you so far. I am proud of you and I will never forget you.

				I made this page because I knew a simple message was not enough. I always wanted to make you a special coding project, so I wanted to do this. I am glad to have met you. I am sorry life is complicated and painful sometimes.
